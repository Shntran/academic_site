</div><b>Drawing as an encoding technique:</b> The bulk of my research has focused on the applications and generalizability of drawing as an encoding technique. I have particularly been interested in examining the use of drawing to ground or "concretize" more abstract concepts. We have found that the use of drawing not only strengthens already existing links between a concrete word and its sensory referent, but can also create more tangible associations when there are few (in the case of abstract words).

<div><b>Comprehension:</b> Whereas memory is a process that involves acquiring, storing, retaining, and retrieving information, comprehension is typically described as the acquisition, integration, and construction of knowledge and understanding. Until now, factors that can influence memory and comprehension have been considered separately, despite both beginning with a common process: encoding. I am interested in examining which encoding techniques can be used to enhance comprehension.

<b>Second Language Learning:</b> Finally, I am also interested in examining which encoding techniques can aid second language learning.
