</div><b>Drawing as an econding technique:</b> I primarily study how drawing enhances later recall of to-be-remembered items, and how this can be modualted by stimulus-driven factors (e.g. valence of the presented stimuli). I am also interested in examining the generalizability of the drawing to more complex stimuli such as sentences, short stories, videos, and autobiographical memories.

<div><b>Comprehension:</b> Whereas memory is a process that involves acquiring, storing, retaining, and retrieving information, comprehension is typically described as the acquisition, integration, and construction of knowledge and understanding. Until now, factors that can influence memory and comprehension have been considered separately, despite both beginning with a common process: encoding. I am interested in examining which encoding techniques can be used to enhance comprehension.
